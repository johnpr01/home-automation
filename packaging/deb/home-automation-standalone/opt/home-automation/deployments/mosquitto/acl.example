# Mosquitto ACL (Access Control List) Example
# This file controls topic-level permissions for MQTT clients

# Syntax:
# user <username>     - Define permissions for a specific user
# topic [read|write|readwrite] <topic>  - Set topic permissions
# pattern [read|write|readwrite] <pattern> - Set pattern permissions
# %c = client ID, %u = username

# Default: Deny all unless explicitly allowed
# (This is the default behavior when ACL is enabled)

# ===========================================
# Home Automation Server (Full Access)
# ===========================================
user home-automation-server
topic readwrite #

# ===========================================  
# Pi Pico Sensors (Write sensor data only)
# ===========================================
# Each sensor can only write to its own room topics
# %c represents the client ID (e.g., "pico-sht30-room1")

user pico-sht30-room1
topic write room-temp/1
topic write room-hum/1

user pico-sht30-room2  
topic write room-temp/2
topic write room-hum/2

user pico-sht30-room3
topic write room-temp/3
topic write room-hum/3

# ===========================================
# Web Dashboard (Read sensor data)  
# ===========================================
user webclient
topic read room-temp/+
topic read room-hum/+ 
topic read $SYS/broker/clients/connected
topic read $SYS/broker/messages/+

# ===========================================
# Admin User (Full Access)
# ===========================================
user admin
topic readwrite #

# ===========================================
# Guest Users (Limited Read Access)
# ===========================================  
user guest
topic read room-temp/living-room
topic read room-temp/kitchen
topic read room-hum/living-room
topic read room-hum/kitchen

# ===========================================
# Pattern-based Rules (Alternative approach)
# ===========================================
# Allow any pico device to write to its assigned room
# pattern write room-temp/%u
# pattern write room-hum/%u

# Allow monitoring clients to read all sensor data
# user monitoring
# topic read room-temp/+
# topic read room-hum/+
# topic read $SYS/#
